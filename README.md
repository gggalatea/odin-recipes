# odin-recipes

The purpose of this project is to build a basic recipe website using the HTML language. This website will have a main index page that will have links to a few recipes.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated basic HTML skills such as:
- Using HTML boilerplate
- Using heading and paragraph tags
- Using anchor and image tags which will reference different HTML pages and resources

I will have also demonstrated use of basic git operations, using both a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

As well as this, I will have also demonstrated use of basic command line commands using Ubuntu.
